# Title: zonalstats_4_join_to_segment_polys.py  (original: ZonalStats_Toba4_JoinToSegmentPolys.py)
# Author: Derek Robillard, with OpenAI assistance
# Purpose: Join the statistical _MEAN and _STDV fields from the merged ZStats table
#          back to the segment polygon feature class (by Id) for mapping, querying,
#          and downstream classification workflows.
# Notes: Snapshot of the exact script used for the MGISA final report.
#        Logic unchanged; only file paths generalized.
# Inputs: Update 'segment_fc' and 'zstats_all' with your own data sources.
# Outputs: The input segment feature class is augmented in place with the selected fields.
# Citation: Robillard (2025). *MGISA landform mapping scripts* [Computer software]. GitHub.
